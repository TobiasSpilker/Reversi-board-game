# Reversi-board-game

This is the digital version of the board game called Reversi. For more information regarding the boardgame itself you can visit:

Some things to notice are that you are not restricted when placing a piece. Just like the analogue version it is therefore important to remember the rules regarding placement. Also, if you skip your turn two times in a row the opposing player wins. The rest of it speaks for itself, enjoy!
